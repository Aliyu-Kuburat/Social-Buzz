### Project Recap
Social Buzz, a rapidly growing social media and content creation company with 500 million monthly              
active users, seeks: 
  - An audit of their big data practices
  - IPO guidance,

### Client Request

Here is the client's request: 

1) They are looking to complete an IPO by the end of next year and need guidance to 
ensure that this goes smoothly. 
2) They are still a small company and do not have the resources to manage the scale that 
they are currently at. They could hire more people, but they want an experienced 
practice to help instead.
3) They want to learn data best practices from a large corporation. Due to the nature of 
their business, they have a massive amount of data so they are keen on 
understanding how the world's biggest companies manage the challenges of big 
data.

### Data Sources

Sales data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is a "content and reaction csv" file, containg detailed information about each viewed contents and their category

The client sent through:

- 7 data sets - each data set contains different columns and values
- A data model - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.
There is a lot of information here and it’s easy to get lost in the data.
So, to make sure you are using the right data to answer the business questions you’ll follow these steps:

 - Requirements gathering
 - Data cleaning
 - Data modelling

## Tools

- Excel (Data cleaning) 
- Power Bi (Reporting)

### Data Transformation
I did the following Data cleaning and transformation: 
 - The Define Objectives and Questions
 - Gather the data needed for the analysis
 - Extract the relevant data needed to address the problem statement
 - Data Cleaning and PreprocessingExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Steps to Transformation**
- Identify which datasets will be required to answer the client’s business question
- Delete null values
- Rename column header
- Replace duplicate values
- Determine the answer to the client’s business question

### Data Analysis
I mostly used Excel and Power bi for this project. 

### Results
 - Top 5 categories are Animal, Science, Healthy eating, Technology and food
 - 16 Reaction Category
 -  4 Content type
 -  January has the highest Gif, audio and photo reactions while May has the highest video
 - May has the highest viewed contents in the year when all 4 contents are considered.
 
### Recommendations

Based on the data analysis, here are some recommendations and next steps for Social Buzz:

## Content Strategy:
**Capitalize on Animal Popularity**: While animal content is viral, investigate if the algorithm is over-favoring it. Could you make sure a healthy balance with other categories?

**Cater to Health & Wellness**: The high engagement for food and healthy eating content suggests a user interest in wellness. Develop more content in these areas, including recipes, fitness tips, and healthy lifestyle inspiration.

**Diversify Content Formats:** While preferences exist, encourage a wider variety of content formats. Explore promoting under-utilized formats like GIFs, especially for technology content.

**Target Science Engagement:** Analyze why science content receives mostly neutral reactions. Consider incorporating more engaging elements like interactive quizzes, experiments, or explainer videos.

## Data-Driven Decisions:
**A/B Testing:** Conduct A/B testing to compare different content types, formats, and posting times to optimize for user engagement.

**Sentiment Analysis Expansion:** Expand sentiment analysis to other categories to better understand user reactions more comprehensively.

### Next Steps:
 - Prioritize recommendations based on potential impact.
